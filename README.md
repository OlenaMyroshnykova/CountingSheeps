## Introduction

This project is aimed at learning JavaScript by building a simple mechanism for counting sheep. It provides a hands-on approach to understanding core JavaScript concepts such as loops, conditionals, and console output.

## Features

- Interactive JavaScript tasks for learning
- Practice with loops and conditionals
- Output results in the browser's console

## Installation

To run this project locally:

git clone https://github.com/OlenaMyroshnykova/CountingSheeps.git  
cd CountingSheeps  
open index.html  
# or  
start index.html  
# or for Linux  
xdg-open index.html

## Usage

1. Open the browser's developer tools (F12 or right-click and select "Inspect", then go to the Console tab).
2. The script will run automatically, and you will see the output of the sheep counting process in the console.
3. You can modify the JavaScript file (`script.js`) to change the number of sheep or add more logic for different JavaScript tasks.

## Example Code

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    console.log(`Oveja ${i} contada`);
}
